# "Wee" Challenges

Several challenges were related to a single website running a "paperbots" service. 
All related challenges included the following explanations:

<p>Good coders should learn one new language every year.</p>

<p>InfoSec folks are even used to learn one new language for every new problem they face (YMMV).</p>

<p>If you have not picked up a new challenge in 2018, you're in for a treat. </p>

<p>We took the new and upcoming <code>Wee</code> programming language from paperbots.io. Big shout-out to Mario Zechner (@badlogicgames) at this point.</p>

<p>Some cool Projects can be created in Wee, like: <a href="https://paperbots.io/project.html?id=URJgCh">this</a>, <a href="https://paperbots.io/project.html?id=kpyyrl">this</a> and <a href="https://paperbots.io/project.html?id=F53thj">that</a>.</p>

<p>Since we already know Java, though, we ported the server (Server.java and Paperbots.java) to Python (WIP) and constantly add awesome functionality.
Get the new open-sourced server at <code>/pyserver/server.py</code>.</p>

<p>Anything unrelated to the new server is left unchanged from commit <code>dd059961cbc2b551f81afce6a6177fcf61133292</code> at 
badlogics <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/paperbots">paperbot github</a> (mirrored up to this commit <a href="https://github.com/domenukk/paperbots/">here</a>).</p>

<p>We even added new features to this better server, like server-side Wee evaluation!</p>

<p>To make server-side Wee the language of the future, we already implemented awesome runtime functions. 
To make sure our VM is 100% safe and secure, there are also assertion functions in server-side Wee that you don't have to be concerned about.</p>
